This is the README file for version 0.9 of
the test suite of conformance to the ISO
Prolog standard based on the Formal specification
of Pierre Deransart, Ali Ed-Dbali and Lurent Cervoni.

The driver for the tests was written by Jonathan Hodgson.


The suite cotains the following files.

README		      This file
inriasuite.pl         The driver.

and a collection of files containing the tests.

The driver can be invoked after loading the file  "inriasuite.pl"
by setting the goal  run_all_tests. Alternatively one can use one of
the  commented out initialization directives provided at the end
of the file to run the suite on load.

LIMITATIONS.

At present this suite does not test IO. Nor does it allow for
tests in which a user defined program  is specified. Future versions
of the suite will remedy this.

REQUIREMENTS.

The driver is written in vanilla ISO prolog. It uses the following (standard)
builtins.

!/0
(=)/2
(=..)/2
(==)/2
(=\=)/2
(>=)/2
(\+)/1
(\==)/2
asserta/1
atomic/1
call/1
catch/3
close/1
copy_term/2
findall/3
(is)/2
nl/0
open/3
read/1
retract/1
set_prolog_flag/2
true/0
var/1
write/1
